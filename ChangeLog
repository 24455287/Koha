	more fines

	* C4/Circulation/Circ2.pm, circ/circulation.pl: Making a change to
	the way charges are handled, the system originally worked such that
	if a borrower owed more than $5 issues werent allowed. This worked
	fine except that often borrowers wish to borrows say 3 pay videos
	at $2 each, then 2 books say. The three pay videos rack up charges
	of $6 and then they cant issue the books until that is paid. 
	Reworked so that it cares about previous charges, not the ones
	accrued during current issue process.
