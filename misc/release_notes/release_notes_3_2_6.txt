======================

    Changes since 3.0:

    * The minimum version of Perl required is now 5.8.8.
    * There are a number of new Perl module dependencies.
      Run ./koha_perl_deps.pl -u -m to get a list of
      any new modules to install during upgrade.

Upgrades
======================

The structure of the acquisitions tables have changed significantly
from 3.0.x.  In particular, the budget hierarchy is quite different.
During an upgrade, a new database table is created called fundmapping
that contains a record of how budgets were mapped.  It is strongly
recommended that users of Koha 3.0.x acquisitions carefully review
the results of the upgrade before resuming ordering in Koha 3.2.x.
