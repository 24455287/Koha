RELEASE NOTES
=============
This version of Koha is the 4rd in the 2.0 "stable" series.
It does not mean that it has no bugs, but many libraries are using it and don't encounter unsolvable problems.
If you want to adopt Koha, please do, but you're warned that this release candidate version may still have some bugs and missing features.
If you test it and let us know about any we haven't seen yet, it will help us to fix them.

The 2.0.x series version is "feature freezed". Only bugs or minor changes will be made in this branch.
The koha team is already working on the 2.2.x version.
In CVS (HEAD branch), developpers can already get 1st draft of a working z3950 server.
