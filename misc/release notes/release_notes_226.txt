IMPROVEMENTS
	=== ACQUISITION ===
	* added a (crontab) script : check_suggestion.pl, that send a mail to the librarian when a suggestion is pending
	* Many improvement in acquisition :
		- online help has been added
		- the order.pl page don't show basket closed since more than 6 months anymore.
		- when recieving an order, you now see the list of existing parcels. The parcel code was, before this release, the " Supplier invoice information". Now when you go to the reciept page, you see all previous recieves, and can create a new parcel, exactly as before. This does not require any change in Koha internals, but we hope it's more clear than previously.
		- when recieving an order in a parcel, you now see all orders still waiting for a receipt. Thus, you can enter isbn/title as previously, or directly clic on a title in the list.
	We worked hard on those new acquisition screens, and hope that you'll find it more easy to use than previously.
	=== CIRCULATION===
	* added a (crontab) script : overduenoticesSelect.pl, that can be used as replacement for overduenotice script. This one has many more parameters, including a filter on branches and an external letter (to avoid the need to modify the script on each release)

	=== CATALOGUE ===
	* new systempref "sortbynonfiling". If you catalogate with complete MARC (including indicators), you can set this pref to Yes. It will check 
	=== CATALOGUING ===
	* added a (crontab) script : delete_authority.pl, that deletes all entries of an authority in a biblio.
	* MARC21 : many plugins have been added (by joshua). It seems you now have as many plugins for fixed length fields in MARC21 than in UNIMARC ! Note that plugins help you filling a tag/subfield in the MARC editor.

	=== MEMBERS ===
	
	=== OPAC ===
	* Amazon content : if AmazonContent new systempref is set AND an AmazonDevKey/AmazoneDevTag is entered in systempreferences AND XML::Simple package is installed, OPAC will show amazon cover pages when available.
	* Recent Acquisition : added a new page to filter recent acquisitions on a given branch.
	* if you use npl templates, you can have an alternate stylesheet (to set it, go to librarian interface >> Parameters > Systempreferences > OPAC > opacstylesheet > modify > /opac-tmpl/npl/en/includes/opac.liblime.css)
	* new systempref : opaccredit. If something (including html) is stored there, the footer of OPAC pages will contain what is there (instead of "Library powered by Koha..." that is on css default templates)
	* new systempref : opaclanguagesdisplay. If set to "yes" (default value), the list of available language is shown. Otherwise, there is no list, koha will stay in default language only.
	* new systempref : opacreadinghistory. If set to "yes" (default value), the reading history will be available on OPAC (for logged in users). If set to "no", the reading history never appears.
	* new systempref : opacnav. In this preference, you can put any html that will be added to your menu. For example, to add a button to reach the koha website : <a class="menu" href="http://www.koha.org" title="Koha english website">Koha</a>

	=== REPORTS ===
	* Inventory : you can now scan in a text file, on an unconnected laptop, every book in your library. Then, just upload the file in Koha. It will "mark as seen" all books. Once you've scanned everything in your library, just query for all books not seen since the beginning of the inventory, and you'll get "lost" books.
	=== SERIALS ===
	* Adding item creation on the fly when recieving serial : if you activate systempref > Catalogue > serialsadditems, below the recieve of an serial, you'll have a form to create an item on the fly. The item contains the callnumber, the branch, the barcode and the location (where applicable). Go to the catalogue after setting a serial to "arrived", and you should see the item created. If you let serialsadditems to OFF, behaviour is unchanged.
