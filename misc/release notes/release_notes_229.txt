* MAJOR bug in addbiblio and additem (Bug 1330). Previously, if you added a field to a biblio it would save it with the same tagorder as one of the items, and then editing an item would result in it being deleted.
* fixed some SQL queries (mySQL5 errors. That does not mean koha 2.2.x is mySQL5 compliant, but that's some errors identified & fixed. Expect koha 2.2.9 to work with fewer problem under mySQL5)
* fixed a SQL typo in overdues fixing on return (database was not properly updated)
* Solved a problem where a plugin value(fixed fields...) would be lost when editing a record
* fixed a bug in expiry date calculation
* ENH in z3950 search : adding a test in search to avoid a system error if the server returns an invalid error (can happend, depending on z3950 server)
* ENH: Added finer ISBD parsing to allow subfield values to contain {}.
* ENH: removed an extra (& useless although harmless) call to MARChtml2xml
* ENH: if branch unknown from Koha, take it from userenv, instead of first-defined. This will set branch to users registration branch if not explicitly set.
