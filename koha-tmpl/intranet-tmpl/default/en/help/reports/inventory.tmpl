<h1>Inventory help</h1>
<p>With this screen, you will be able to do invetory of your library</p>
<p>You have 2 ways to do this :</p>
<ul>
<li>list unseen books and search them in shelves</li>
<li>Scan all books and tell Koha you've seen them</li>
</ul>
<p>Koha can do both !</p>
<h2>List unseen books and search them in shelves</h2>
<p> In the 1st bloc, you can select :
<ul>
<li>a itemcallnumber range: to limit the list to a small physical shelf</li>
<li>a date last seen: to see books unseen since a long time only</li>
</ul>
<p>If you validate your search, you'll get a list of book. Reach your shelves, search them, and, if you see them, click on them</p>
<h2>Scan all books and tell Koha you've seen them</h2>
<p>This feature is new in Koha 2.2.6 : you can now scan ALL the books in your shelves (with a barcode reader and a laptop) and store them in a text file (from notepad or any text-only editor <b>This does NOT include MS-word or OpenOffice.org</b>)</p>
<p>Once you have a long barcode list, reach the second bloc on inventory.pl, and upload the file : all items you have scanned will automatically be modified to have datelastseen set to whatever you wan</p>
<p>Once you've done with your library, you can look at missing books by querying the 1st bloc for books unseen since the beginning of your inventory</p>

<p>Note that inventory is calculated on a "date last seen" flag. This flag is automatically set every time a book circulate</p>
