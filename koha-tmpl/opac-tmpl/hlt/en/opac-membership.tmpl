</p><h2>Joining the Library</h2>
<p>
</p><ul><li>Membership is free for anyone who lives, or pays rates, in the Horowhenua or Kapiti Coast District.<br />
</li><li>You can join at Levin, Foxton or Shannon Library and may borrow and return items at any of these libraries.<br />
</li><li>You'll need to bring 2 forms of ID - one that has your address printed on it like a bank statement or letter, and the other with your signature or photograph.<br />
</li><li>When you sign your new card we'll ask you to agree to some <a href="/cgi-bin/koha/opac-membership.pl#conditions">conditions</a><br />
</li><li>If you're under 16 we need a guarantor - an adult (usually a parent) who agrees to be responsible for the books you borrow - your adult needs to come to the library with you when you sign up.<br />
</li><li>Remember to get yourself a Password or PIN when you register. This means you will be able to access your record online.<br />
</li><li>We have <a href="/about-us/index.html">thousands of things</a> you can borrow and do at the Library.
</li></ul><p>
</p><h2>Become an Online Member </h2>
<p>
You can become an online member when you join the library or any time after that.  If you've already got a new plastic library card, all you need is a password. Next time you're in alibrary, come to the Help desk with your library card and we'll issue you a password.
</p><p>
If you forget your password at any time, just come back to the counter,<br />
with your card or other ID and we can reset it.
</p><p>
Using your library card and password you can review your borrower record with us, check the books you have out, renew them, make requests (reserves), and update your personal details all from the terminals in the library or your own PC at home.
</p><p>
