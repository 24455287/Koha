Manual Release Testing


The following document outlines some steps to follow to manually test
for bugs in a release candidate. 

When reporting bugs, please use <http://bugs.koha.org/>.  Please
include information about:  What OS, release, and distribution you're
using.  Also, which webserver (including version number), which RDMS
(including version number), and the version of Perl you're running.
Do not be too suprised if a developer gets back to you with a request
for more information about your environment.


1) Installing Koha.
   You should be able to install Koha using installer.pl.  We're
   hoping that this method works cleanly with RedHat and Debian Linux
   (at least).  We'd like to hear problem reports about any OS you're
   using though.

      + Add a couple of branches

      + Add some item types (make sure to create at least one
        itemtype with charges, and one itemtype with a 0 day loan
        length)

4) Members
    Please try to perform the following tasks:

        preference as well)
